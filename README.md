# Mercury Game Engine
## Introduction
This repository is the starting point to acquiring the Mercury game engine and its useful submodules. I have made this repo public so that perhaps my lessons can guide those on a similar journey. It is not the most optimized engine available, and there are other engines Iâ€™d recommend for a professional project due to the polish that can only come from massive user bases. Thus, however, can perhaps inspire game engine developers in delving deeper into the guts of the heart of any game.

## Caveats
This engine has been developed as a learning tool for myself. Most of the features and implementation have come from my experience and ventures into creativity, especially the earlier iterations. 

Some of the solutions in the engine were hand rolled in order to gain experience and a deeper understanding of the structures, concepts, and implementations. These are such libraries as the XML parser, the Json API, the DAE loader. There are likely solutions better suited for your needs. Rely on more official, highly tested libraries for a release.
