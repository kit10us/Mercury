# Mercury Game Engine
## Introduction
This repository is the starting point to acquiring the Mercury game engine and its useful submodules. I have made this repo public so that perhaps my lessons can guide those on a similar journey. It is not the most optimized engine available, and there are other engines Iâ€™d recommend for a professional project due to the polish that can only come from massive user bases. Thus, however, can perhaps inspire game engine developers in delving deeper into the guts of the heart of any game.

## Caveats
This engine has been developed as a learning tool for myself. Most of the features and implementation have come from my experience and ventures into creativity, especially the earlier iterations. 

Some of the solutions in the engine were hand rolled in order to gain experience and a deeper understanding of the structures, concepts, and implementations. These are such libraries as the XML parser, the Json API, the DAE loader. There are likely solutions better suited for your needs. Rely on more official, highly tested libraries for a release.

## Working with the Repo
The Mercury repository is a colletion of submodules required to build Mercury Engine, its tests, and sample games. Submodules are used for separation of versioning, minimizing repo sizes, sharing libraries with other applications, and general organizational structuring. 

The "glue" features that link the various libraries, projects, tools, etc., together is housed directly in the Mercury repository. That which owns the other submodules.

That being said, working with submodules can be intimidating to some developers. Often this can be attributed to the past complexity of the git feature, as well as gits inherent complexity. Git is, frankly, complex, which often breeds the "use what I know" paradigm we can all be guilty of. Preaching done.

Here are some tips on working with submodules, especially as they pertain to the Mercury repo.

### The Repo ###
The repo includes some submodules that are not owned/supported by myself. Thus, sub commands that work with Mercury's submodules, might not work with those submodules. This is especially noticed with some commands executed via gits submodule _foreach_ command.

### Pulling the Mercury repo
git clone git@github.com:kit10us/Mercury

### Pulling all submodules
git submodule init
git submodule update

### Working with Submodules
You can perform console commands on all repositories. This is not limited to git commands:
git submodule foreach "git status"
